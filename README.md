# Predict Funding - Binary Classifier Deep Learning
<img src="Images/neural-network-diagram.svg">

### Summary
Used Tensorflow to create a classifier that uses a neural networks model to predict whether funding applicants will be successful. A dataset of more than 34,000 organisations that received funding historically was used to create the features the algorithm uses to make predictions.

### Hyperparameter Optimisation using Keras Tuner
* The hyper parameters were optimised using Keras Tuner which tests and selects the optimal hyper parameters.


### Code and Analysis

The Funding_predictor notebook contains the model created using test parameters.

The Funding_predictor-optimized notebook uses Keras Tuner to create the model with optimal hyperparameters.

### Conclusion and Report

The conclusion and report is contained in the Funding_predictor-optimized notebook at the top of the notebook.
